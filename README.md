# E-commerce-RFM-Analysis
Transactional data analysis for marketing and customer retention strategies
# Customer Retention and Segmentation Analysis (RFM Model)

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail e-commerce. The main objective is to translate sales data into actionable marketing strategies, optimizing customer retention and ad budget allocation through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) segmentation.

## The Business Problem
Instead of treating all customers equally with expensive, mass-marketing campaigns, this analysis aims to answer four fundamental strategic questions for the Management team:

1. **VIP Identification:** Who are our "Champion" customers (most profitable and loyal), and what percentage of total revenue do they represent?
2. **Churn Prevention:** Which high-value customers are at risk of churning and urgently need a targeted retention campaign?
3. **Growth Potential:** Who are the recent customers with high potential that we should target with cross-selling strategies?
4. **Budget Optimization:** How can we structure personalized offers based on each customer segment to maximize the ROI of our marketing campaigns?

## Methodology and Tools
* **Data:** E-commerce transactional data (Invoices, Dates, Prices, Customer IDs).
* **Methodology:** RFM Analysis to score customers from 1 to 5 across three key dimensions.
* **Tools Used:**
  * **Python:** Core programming language for data processing.
  * **Pandas & NumPy:** Data cleaning, manipulation, and RFM metric calculation.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization and statistical graphics to present business insights.
  * **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab:** Interactive environment for documenting the analysis process.
